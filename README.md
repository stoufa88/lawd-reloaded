# Lawd 2

Lawd 2 is desktop streaming powered app where people hunt down torrents.
We use TheMovieDB for browsing shows (movies and tvs) and a parse server for torrents association.

Good hunting :)

## Config
Replace parameters in config.example.com with you own tmdb api key.
For parse server api key, ask for it.

## Downloads
The app will be soon available for download in multi platforms, thanks to Electron.js.

## Run

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
